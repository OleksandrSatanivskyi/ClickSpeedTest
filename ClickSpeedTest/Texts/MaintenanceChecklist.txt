Keeping your home in optimal condition requires a lot of attention and effort. With plumbing, HVAC, and electrical systems to look after, Boston homeowners have no shortage of household responsibility. Nobody enjoys this seasonal upkeep, but paying the price of neglect is even worse. Here’s a quick checklist of some DIY maintenance that can help prevent costly damage. Clean mineral deposits off faucets and showerheads If you’ve ever noticed a mysterious white, chalky substance developing on faucets or showerheads throughout your home, you’ve encountered what’s known as limescale. These calcium deposits are left behind as water evaporates on plumbing fixtures. Limescale builds up over time and eventually harms the integrity of faucets and showerheads, not to mention the toll it takes on the aesthetics of your home. It’s a good idea to scrub away these mineral deposits at least once a year or whenever they become readily noticeable. An old toothbrush and a mixture of water, baking soda, and water should do the trick. Just make sure not to scrub too hard that you end up damaging your fixtures. Inspect your water softener and refill the salt supply Limescale might not pose a significant threat on the outside of your home’s plumbing system, but it’s a different story when these mineral deposits build up on the inside of pipes. Calcium, magnesium, and other minerals can accumulate resulting in clogged pipes. Water softeners play a key role in preventing this problem by removing most of the minerals from hard water before it enters your home’s plumbing system. You should inspect your water softener every 1 to 2 months to see if salt levels need replenishing. Keeping up with the salt demands of your water softener can reduce the potential for limescale development within your plumbing system.
