Laura Virginia O'Hanlon Douglas, known as Virginia O'Hanlon, was the eight-year-old girl who wrote in 1897 to The New York Sun asking if Santa Claus is real. The editorial reply to the letter was written by general editor Francis Pharcellus Church (1839-1906) and is possibly the most famous editorial in American history.[1]
Virginia wrote in the letter that her father, Dr. Philip F. O'Hanlon (1863-1937), a coroner's assistant, said that if she could see the requested reply in print, then she could believe of the existence of Santa. Hence, "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus" has long since become a classic story of the season. Actor Charles Bronson (1921-2003) played Church in a 1991 television film about the famous letter. In 1974, ABC aired an animated television special about Virginia.
