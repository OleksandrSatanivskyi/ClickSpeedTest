Monkeys are clever, social animals. They are known for running and leaping through trees with ease. Like apes and humans, monkeys belong to the group of mammals called primates. Monkeys look somewhat like apes such as chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas. But monkeys differ from apes in several ways. For instance, every monkey has a tail, even if it is just a tiny nub. Apes do not have tails. Monkeys also generally have narrower chests than apes do.There are about 200 species, or types, of monkey. Scientists divide them into two groups, Old World monkeys and New World monkeys. Old World monkeys include baboons, drills, mandrills, macaques, guenons, langurs, and colobus monkeys. Among the New World monkeys are marmosets, tamarins, howler monkeys, spider monkeys, squirrel monkeys, woolly monkeys, and capuchins.
