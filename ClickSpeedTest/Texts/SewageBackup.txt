A sewage backup occurs when a drainage system experiences an obstruction restricting the normal flow of wastewater. In addition to being a repulsive thought, limited or completely blocked wastewater systems pose a major threat to Boston homeowners and their properties. The longer the problem can persist, the more costly and significant the damage. Luckily, there are some telltale signs that can help you catch the problem in its early stages to prevent major issues. Strong smells coming from the drain The main function of wastewater systems is to remove sewage and other contaminated water away from your home to a municipal system. When there’s a drainage issue, wastewater sits somewhere within your home’s drainage system. Over time, this accumulation of sewage emits a foul smell. We’ll spare you a detailed description, but the smell is unmistakably pungent and putrid. Typically, you’ll notice the smell emanating from various drains at one time. This is an undeniable sign that wastewater isn’t draining properly. Slow or no drainage throughout the home It’s not uncommon for Boston homeowners to experience clogged drains every once in a while. But, if several drains throughout your home are affected, a sewage backup is likely to blame. Unlike blocked drains that only impact a single section of plumbing, sewage obstructions prevent drainage throughout the home. Often, these drainage issues are first noticeable on the lower floors because they’re closer to the root problem. Sewage spilling from the cleanout pipe
